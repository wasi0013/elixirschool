Some of these translations include: [Việt ngữ][vi], [简体中文][zh-hans], [繁體中文][zh-hant], [Español][es], [Slovenčina][sk], [日本語][ja], [Polski][pl], [Português][pt], [Русский][ru], [Bahasa Indonesia][id], [Bahasa Melayu][ms], [Українською][uk], [한국어][ko], [Italiano][it], [Deutsch][de], [বাংলা][bn], [Türkçe][tr], [ภาษาไทย][th], and [Ελληνικά][gr].
